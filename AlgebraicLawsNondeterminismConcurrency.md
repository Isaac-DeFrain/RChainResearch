# Algebraic Laws for Nondeterminism and Concurrency - Matthew Hennessey, Robin Milner

#### Abstract
Since a nondeterministic and concurrent program may, in general, communicate reaptedly with its environment, its meaning cannot be be presented naturally as an input/output function (as is often done in the denotational approach to semantics). This is an alternative viewpoint. First, a definition is given of what it is for two programs or program parts to be equivalent for all observers; then two program parts are said to be *observation congruent* if and only if they are equivalent in all program contexts. The *behavior* of a program part, i.e. its meaning, is defined to be its observation congruence class.

Algebraic axiomatization of observation congruence for a sequence of simple languages expressing finite (terminating) behaviors. Moreover with addition of recursion and another simple extension, the algebraic language described here becomes a calculus for writing and specifying concurrent programs and for proving their properties.

## Introduction
If either the mathematics or the logic is to have any relevance, a link must be made between the denotational model and the behavior, or operational semantics, of the programs. One way of making a link is to demand that the denotational model be *fully abstract* with respect to the operational semantics. This means

> Two program phrases should have should have the same denotation if and only if the operational meaning of every program remains unchaged when one phrase is replaced by the other.

Exact meaning of behavior of nondeterministic or concurrent programs is far from clear and one possible definition is introduced in this paper. The essence of the approach:

> The behavior of a program is determinied by how it communicates with an observer (#quantumbehavior).

Begin by assuming that every program action is observable in this way; later, unobservable actions (in particular, internal communications between concurrent components) are intoduced.

The definition is applied to a sequence of simple languages for expressing porgrams with finite behavior, and show that in each case it can be characterized by algebraic axioms. This leads automatically to a *fully abstract model*; it is just the *initial algebra* generated by the axioms.
